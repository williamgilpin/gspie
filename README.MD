# Simulation of Stochastic Differential Equations

The files in this repository implement a simple version of the Gillespie "first reaction" algorithm for the simulation of systems of many coupled, stochastic reactions. A simple physical scenario in which this problem occurs is gene transcription (DNA -> RNA) when there are low numbers of mRNA molecules present
